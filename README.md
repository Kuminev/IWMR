## Water and soceity, a conceptual frame (CF) for communities

The read of the CF starts from the outside, with 2 arrows that are the scale and the time. The scale could be Global, Regional, National or Local, but also you can define another scale for example a major basin (Binational like Sixaola River Basin) or a micro basin (Mar√≠a Aguilar River Basin). The time must be defined in function of the temporal space that we want to work, for example it could start in the 70's and ends in the  near future (2025), this definition could help to understand some dynamics within the space we are working with. Note that the scale and the time are in the major Boundary.

Is importante to point that the climate and the socioeconomic (system) are elements that influence in the flows of water, and it is present in the major boundry of the analysis. A modification in any of those will bring modification in all the scale of the system of work.

In the CF I define the Entries to the system of work (yellow square) by the flows of water that get into the system, it could be Virtual Water or Real Water.

In this CF there are three tiers of elements that could be defined for different scenarios. The first are the ACTORS, wich refers to the diferente entities how participate in the use, consumption or has some link. The second is the INSTITUTIONS and those refer to the legal frame (laws, the jurisprudence, the constitution, regulatory plan), government institutions, non government institution and the available technologies (popular knowledge, western science). The third are the ACTIVITIES wich embrace the industry, the agriculture, the domestic use, the environmental use of water. These elements are joined by strong arrows (both ways) because they define each other.

In the end we have the outcome, which are the products that we can obtain from the interaction in system of work, those could be pollution patterns (sewage waters, solid waste, externalities, shortage).

We have the feedback like a product that could get back to the system after the analysis of the outcomes.
